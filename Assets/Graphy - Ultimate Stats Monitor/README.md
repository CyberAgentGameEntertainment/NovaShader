**Main Features:**
- Graph & Text:

### Contributing

Let's make Graphy the go-to for stats monitoring in Unity!

I would really appreciate any contributions! Below you can find a roadmap for future planned features and optimisations that you might be able to help out with. If you want to make a big pull request, please do it on the "dev" branch.

Create a GitHub issue if you want to start a discussion or request a feature, and please label appropriately.

You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2KgNEHK?) for active discussions with other members of the community.

### Roadmap

**Planned features (No ETA):**

  - Add GfxDriver stats to the RAM module.
  - Scale Canvas (GetComponent<Canvas>().scaleFactor *= multiplier;) -> If it changes, set again.
  - Make a template for a graph + text module so people can create their own easily.
  - Allow storing FPS for a predetermined time to allow benchmarks.
  - Dump all Graphy Data as a string to:
  	- File.
	- Send to server.
	- Send mail.
  - Add a preprocessor key #GRAPHY to avoid adding the asset in builds.
